# Boston Housing Data

This data set contains 506 records of 14 fields about housing prices in
the Boston metro area. The data are sourced from
Harrison D, Rubinfeld DL. Hedonic housing prices and the demand for Clean Air.
*Journal of Environmental Economics and Management*.
1978;5(1):81-102. doi:10.1016/0095-0696(78)90006-2.

Another suggested source is:
Belsley DA, Kuh E, Welsch RE. Regression Diagnostics. Identifying Influential
Data and Sources of Collinearity. New York, NY: Wiley; 1980. 
But I don't know why it's suggested, I haven't read it.

Unfortunately the article is owned by Elsevier so I don't think I can get away
with putting the entire article in this repo.

The variables listed in the data are:

* *crim*: per capita crime rate by town.
* *zn*: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,00 sq.ft.
* *indus*: proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
* *chas*: Charles River indicator variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0
otherwise).
* *nox*: nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
* *rm*: average number of rooms per dwelling.
* *age*: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
* *dis*: weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centers.
* *rad*: index of acessibility to radial highways.
* *tax*: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.
* *ptratio*: pupil-teacher ratio by town.
* *black*: (1000)(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of Black people
living in a town.
* *lstat*: lower status of the population (percent).
* *medv*: median value of owner-occupied homes in $1,000s.

This codebook is mostly copied verbatim from a kaggle competition where the
link to the data no longer works:
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/boston-housing/overview.
I reproduced it here since who knows how long that link will even work.
